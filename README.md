# Project Image Hosting Repository

This repository is used to store and manage images for my projects. It serves as a centralized location for screenshots, diagrams, and other visual assets that are referenced across multiple repositories.

* Each project has its own folder inside the `/images` directory.
* Images are grouped by project to keep assets organized and easy to maintain.

## 🖼️ How to Add Images

1. Navigate to the `/images` directory.
2. Create a new folder with your project name if it does not already exist.
3. Add your image files to the folder.
4. Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `dashboard-overview.png`).

## 🔗 Using Images in Other Repositories

You can reference images using raw GitHub links in your markdown files:

```md
![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<username>/<repo-name>/main/images/project-name/image.png)
```

Replace `<username>` and `<repo-name>` with your GitHub details.

## 🧭 Naming Conventions

* Use lowercase letters and hyphens for filenames.
* Avoid spaces and special characters.
* Prefer descriptive names that explain the image content.

## ✅ Best Practices

* Optimize images before uploading to reduce file size.
* Use consistent formats (`.png` or `.jpg`).
* Remove unused images to keep the repository clean.
